# Trinomial triangle 
### Python 3.7 program that includes the following functionality: <br>
1. prints trinomial triangle for given LENGTH (height of the triangle) <br>_(see more https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinomial_triangle)_ 
###### please notice, that the asymptotic notation is more than O(LENGTH<sup>2</sup>), because it is based on the function below
2. for given LENGTH and TOTAL values returns the list of LENGTH long lists, consisting only of _-1, 0 and 1_ numbers, which sum is TOTAL
###### thus the number of all possible variations is a number in the Trinomial triangle <br>where you can imagine TOTAL horizontal axis (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3) for TOTAL = 3<br> and LENGTH vertical axis (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) for LENGTH = 5
**Use it just by running a program, then you will be able to choose a needed function**
